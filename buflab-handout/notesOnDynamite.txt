notes from class n level 3 dynamite:
	//flow of how our exploit works:
		//getbuf executes
		//gets overwrites our return address
		//getbuf returns to ret addr
	//to get to exploit code, need address of string
unsigned dynamite( int x )
{
	return <cookie>;
	if (x)
	{
		void *addr = <address
		goto addr;		
	}
}
